# AmongUsTracker
Track who you think is trustworthy or suspicious in the game 

A tracker to help people keep track of who they think is good or who they think is suspicious in the game "Among Us" from InnerSloth.

Users can click on each individual character to change their background to green, red, gray with a cross, or back to neutral. I intended for green background = trustworthy, red = suspicious, gray = dead or not in game, neutral = no opinion yet.

Simple html page that uses the character images from the Among Us wiki.

In order to use it, a user will have to download the html file alongside the images folder (which contains the character images). Please make sure that the images folder is on the same level as the html file (the html file should not be inside the images folder).
